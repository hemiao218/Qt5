\title Qt Bluetooth
\brief Qt Bluetooth enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.

Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless technology. It
has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal
for transferring data between devices.

Bluetooth connectivity is based on basic device management, such as scanning
for devices, gathering information about them, and exchaning data between
them.

\section1 Getting started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:
