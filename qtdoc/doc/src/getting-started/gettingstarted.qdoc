    \title Getting Started with Qt
    \brief A quick guide for developers

    \section1 Downloading and Installing Qt

    Qt framework and tools can be installed using an online installer,
    standalone binary installers or using source packages and building
    yourself. The open-source version is found from the Qt Project
    \l {Opensource Downloads}{Downloads} page, which contains download
    links for Qt and Qt Creator for different development platforms.

    The commercial versions are available for free trial from
    \l{Try Qt Enterprise}{Digia}.

    \section2 Installing with the Installation Program

    The Qt Installation Program can download the Qt libraries and tools as well
    as the reference documentation and code samples. The
    \l{Qt Installation
    Program} page contains information about installation process.

    \section2 Installing from the Qt Sources

    Qt may also be installed from the sources. Simply download the sources
    (available from the \l{Opensource Downloads}{Downloads} page) and follow the
    instructions according to the development platform page here:
    \l{Building Qt Sources}.

    \section1 Exploring the Tools

    \l{Qt Creator}, the Qt IDE, integrates development tools such as a code
    editor, a UI designer, a debugger, and other project management tools such
    as version control.

    For more information, these pages describe the tools and processes involved:
    \list
    \li \l{Development Tools}
    \li \l{Qt Creator Manual}
    \endlist

    \section1 Creating Applications Using Qt

    Qt 5's modularized nature means that modules may be omitted during the
    build process, producing libraries that are smaller in size and with
    less complexities. Depending on their support and target platforms,
    modules are either an \e essential or an \e add-on.

    These pages explain the modules and the support level for different
    platforms: \list \li \l{All Modules}{Qt Modules} \li \l{Supported Platforms}
    \endlist

    To help you on your way, we created two tutorials creating two similar
    applications, but using different approaches. One implements the user
    interface using Qt Quick, while the other uses Qt Widgets.

    \list
    \li \l{Getting Started Programming with Qt Widgets}
    \li \l{Getting Started Programming with Qt Quick}
    \endlist

    \section1 Where to Go from Here

    We invite you to explore the rest of Qt. We prepared overviews which help
    you decide which APIs to use and our examples demonstrate how to use our
    API.

    \list
    \li \l{Qt Overviews} - list of topics about application development
    \li \l{Qt Examples and Tutorials}{Examples and Tutorials} - code samples and tutorials
    \li \l{Qt Reference Pages} - a listing of C++ and QML APIs
    \endlist

    Qt's vibrant and active community site, \l{http://qt-project.org} houses
    a wiki, a forum, and additional learning guides and presentations.
