    \title Qt Licensing
    \brief Information about licenses and licensing issues.

    Qt is available under three different licensing options designed to accommodate
    the needs of our various users.

    Qt licensed under our \l{Qt Commercial License}{commercial license agreement}
    is appropriate for development
    of proprietary/commercial software where you do not want to share any source code
    with third parties or otherwise cannot comply with the terms of the GNU LGPL
    version 2.1 or GNU GPL version 3.0.

    Qt licensed under the \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} version 2.1
    is appropriate for the development of Qt applications provided you can comply
    with the terms and conditions of the GNU LGPL version 2.1.

    Qt licensed under the \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)} version 3.0 is
    appropriate for the development of Qt applications where you wish to use such
    applications in combination with software subject to the terms of the GNU GPL
    version 3.0 or where you are otherwise willing to comply with the terms of the
    GNU GPL version 3.0.

    Qt documentation is licensed under the terms of the \l{GNU Free Documentation
    License (FDL)} version 1.3, as published by the Free Software Foundation.
    Alternatively, you may use the documentation in accordance with the terms
    contained in a written agreement between you and Digia.

    Please see \l{http://qt.digia.com/licensing} for an overview of Qt licensing.

    \title Other Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief Information about other licenses used for Qt components and third-party code.

    Qt contains some code that is not provided under the
    \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)},
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)} or the
    \l{Qt Commercial License}, but rather under
    specific licenses from the original authors.
    This page lists the licenses used, names the authors, and links
    to the places where it is used.

    Digia gratefully acknowledges these and other contributions
    to Qt. We recommend that programs that use Qt also acknowledge
    these contributions, and quote these license statements in an
    appendix to the documentation.

    \section1 FreeType

    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt
    for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h,
    ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications
    has been made to these files:

    \list
    \li Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name
    conflicts in \c{qrasterdefs_p.h}.
    \li Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with
    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \li Changed behavior in \c{ftraster.c} to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \li Implemented support in \c{ftraster.c} for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \li Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in \c{ftraster.c}.
    \li Renamed \c{ftraster.h} as \c{qblackraster_p.h}.
    \li Renamed \c{ftraster.c} as \c{qblackraster.c}.
    \li Renamed \c{ftgrays.h} as \c{qgrayraster_p.h}.
    \li Renamed \c{ftgrays.c} as \c{qgrayraster.c}.
